# HollaLinux Goals
As part of the Tarsier Projects to help building 
the software ecosystem upon RISC-V,
this unofficial riscv64 port of Slackware
does not try to support other architecture than riscv64 for now,
and support for riscv32 is not a priority either.

Porting work would be carrying out with care 
to not break anything that already running well 
on other architectures supported by Slackware 
such as x86 and arm.

ToDo list
- [ ] Run on Real Hardware
- [ ] Xfce
- [ ] X11
- [x] Bootstrap GCC Toolchain
- [x] Boot on QEMU no Graphic
