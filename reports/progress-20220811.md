## Bootstrap Rust 1.62.1

Rust support for riscv64 is close to mature since version 1.59 and up.
Using officially recommanded method to install Rust as start point
to bootstrap Rust in this project:
```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
and edit the build script pointing commands provided by Rust to the
just installed officially built binaries.

The building went smoothly and we got the first cross built Rust package.

After the just cross built Rust package being installed,
it is used as the operating system provided Rust to build the package
again and then agian to ensure a 3-stage bootstrap is completed,
though the building of the Rust package itself uses a 3-stage bootstrap
method to exclude things from the build host.
