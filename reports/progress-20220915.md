# Progress Brief Report 20220915

## SlackBuilds/audio

Massive building has been started for the `audio`
subset of packages from SlackBuilds.org,
will be available in repo under
`slackbuilds-riscv64/15.0.20220920-alfa/audio`.

As the HollaLinux project grows, 
packages will be put under directories like `audio`
defined by the upstreams and linked into `everything`.
`alternative` will host some duplicated packages which
are built with different configurations
or use different source version.
