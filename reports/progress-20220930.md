## Build LLVM 15 with Clang 13 and ld.bfd

Lots of commits related to riscv64 has been
merged in LLVM 15 and it is time to upgrade
LLVM for such benefits form upstream since
HollaLinux is a riscv64 port though official
Slackware current branch still uses 14.0.6
at the time of this report being written.

The LLD linker comes with LLVM 13 cannot
be used directly during building LLVM
itself on riscv64 but LLD is expected to
be almost fully functional for riscv64
since LLVM 15 and so will it be used
instead of `ld.gold` for HollaLinux.

Building LLVM 15.0.0 using 
CMake 3.23.2 and Ninja 1.10.2
with `ninja -j33`
on 32-core QEMU 7.0.0 riscv64 VM 
has failed but `-j1` goes fine.
Though the reason of failure
is not totally figured out yet
it might be caused by the `ld.bfd`
consuming huge amount of memory.
This problem will be tested 
when build 15.0.1 and later
with both `ld.bfd` and `ld.lld`.
