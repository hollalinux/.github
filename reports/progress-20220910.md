## Extend build script for QEMU image partition to use LABEL

https://repo.tarsier-infra.com/Slackware-RISC-V/slackware-riscv64/15.0.20220910-fall/qemu-img-make/make-qemu-img.sh

The build script now take charge of creating the new image file
and mount it as loop device. Then a new partition for root `/`
is created and formatted with `mkfs.btrfs` as default.

The root partition `/` is mounted during Linux kernel boot 
using `PARTLABEL` in `/extlinux/extlinux.conf` 
and during `init` using `LABEL` in `/etc/fstab`
(though `PARTLABEL` may also be used in `/etc/fstab`)
in hope that this will help the image to be tested without much modification 
on real machines in the future as long as they use `u-boot` as bootloader
or any other bootloader that respects `extlinux`.
