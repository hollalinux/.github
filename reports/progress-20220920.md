## Build LLVM 13 with Clang 13 and ld.bfd

LLVM 13.0.1 has been built with GCC 11.3 and ld.bfd
successfully but the resulted Clang cannot find
candidate GCC and libraries like `libgcc`.

The cause of this problem is now identified that
the default Clang target on QEMU-system-riscv64 is
`riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu` which is incompatible with
the GCC target `riscv64-slackware-linux` that defined
by Slackware build script for GCC.

A symbol link from `/usr/lib/gcc/riscv64-slackware-linux`
to `/usr/lib/gcc/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu` solves this
problem but it is finally decided that 
`LLVM_DEFAULT_TARGET_TRIPLE` should be set using
```
-DLLVM_DEFAULT_TARGET_TRIPLE=${ARCH}-slackware-linux \
```
during configuring to have the same default target as
Slackware GCC. `riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu` is detected
during building targeting `host` as well and thus Clang 
can search for both candidate names.

With `riscv64-slackware-linux` as default target for Clang,
using GCC for the first cross build and
LLVM 13 can then be built with Clang 13 itself.

However `ld.bfd` is still used during the building
since `ld.gold` is still not available on riscv64 
and `ld.lld` must be used with `-mno-relax`.
